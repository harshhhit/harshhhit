👋 Hi, I’m @harshhhit

👀 I’m a DevOps Engineer with a passion for automating and optimizing workflows. I have hands-on experience with AWS CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, GCP Cloud Build, and Jenkins. I also have a solid understanding of Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and Terraform.

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced Kubernetes orchestration and exploring new CI/CD tools to enhance my DevOps toolkit.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve cloud infrastructure, continuous integration, and continuous deployment. Let’s build something amazing together!
